# Friendly Animals

Extend the Animal class provided with three more subclasses: `Cat`, `Dog`, `Human`.

Include a method `talk` in each one of the subclasses. The `talk` method should return different options based on the type of animal:

* `Cat`: should return `"Meow!"`
* `Dog`: should return `"Ruff!"`
* `Human`: should return `"Hello!"`
