# Is Char in String

Use a while loop to complete the function `char_in_string` to check if `char_to_look_for` is in `a_string`. 

Do NOT use the `in` keyword to determine if it is in there. 

Return True if it is there and False if it is not.

Examples:

```python
>>>  char_in_string("abcdef", "X")
False

>>>  char_in_string("abcXdef", "X")
True
```

Note: If you find the character, you can leave the loop early by using a `break` or a `return` statement.
