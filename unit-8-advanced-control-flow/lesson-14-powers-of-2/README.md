# Powers of 2

You've done something similar to this with a while loop, now do it with a for loop! You'll have to use the range() function.

Complete `powers_of_2` using a for loop so that receives the `power` and returns 2 to that `power`.

Examples:

```python
>>> powers_of_2(0)
1

>>> powers_of_2(1)
2

>>> powers_of_2(2)
4

>>> powers_of_2(3)
8
```
