# Divisible numbers comprehension with multiple terms

Write a function that receives a list of numbers and a list of terms and returns only the elements that are divisible by ALL the terms. You must use two nested list comprehensions to solve it.

```python
divisible_numbers([12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [2, 3]) == [12, 6]
```
