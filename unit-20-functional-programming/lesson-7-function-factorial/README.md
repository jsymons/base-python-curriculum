# Function Factorial

The objective of this assignment is to write a factorial function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial).

In order to do that we'll define 2 helper functions:
 * factorial_terms: will receive a number and return the
                            list of terms to compute the factorial.
 * compute_factorial: Will receive a list of terms and compute de factorial.
                                *You must use the `reduce` function*

Finally, the `factorial` function will get a number and using both helper functions will compute
the answer. The `factorial` function can have just 1 line.

Use the tests to see the complete specification of what you're required to write.
