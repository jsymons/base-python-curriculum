    "# Introduction to Python Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are the most commonly used Python collection. You'll find lists (or similar types of collections) in EVERY other programming language. Sometimes they're called arrays, sometimes \"linked lists\". They are all fundamentally similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists (and other collections) are used to store _collections_ (sorry, captain obvious) of elements. Whenever you want to store several occurrences of a given entity, you'll use a collection. Python lists are created using square brackets (`[]`). Examples:"
